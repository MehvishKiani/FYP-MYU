# 🌱 IoT-Driven Vertical Farming Using Deep Learning

*For Cultivation & Growth Stage Prediction of Medicinal Plants*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project integrates *IoT, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning* to optimize vertical farming for *medicinal plants*.

* IoT sensors monitor real-time environmental conditions.
* Deep Learning models predict *growth stages* of plants.
* A web-based dashboard visualizes insights for farmers.

The goal is to improve *yield, sustainability, and automation* in smart farming.
